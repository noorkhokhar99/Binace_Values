# Welcome to python-binance


Why binance.py?

The binance api is complex to grasp and using a wrapper saves time but also ensures that the right practices are adopted. Binance.py offers a modern and asynchronous solution.

Features

Covers general endpoints (test connectivity and get exchange informations)
Covers market data endpoints
Covers Account endpoints (create and manage orders)
Covers user data stream (receive real time user updates)
Covers web socket streams (receive real time market updates)

Async support

Completely free and without limitations

What it does not
Binance.py does not cover the withdraw API
Binance.py does not cover the margin trading API
If you need these features, don't open an issue to ask me to implement them
